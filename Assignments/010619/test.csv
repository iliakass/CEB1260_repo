Two weeks ago MPSJ dog catcher came over to catch stray dogs at my house area. One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too. She is very obedient coz I think she had an owner before. She is house trained. I kept her in my living room all this time to separate her from my existing dogs. She didn't destroy anything in my house and never pee and poop everywhere. She will howl when she needs to go toilet.",f45457bdc,1.0

I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home.

I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom.",8f15fc3d8,11.0

Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Louis must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",e49b7c262,8.0

Her sister was killed by a car a few months ago while her brother suddenly disappeared one day. When we rescued Estee, she was very sick. The vet said she had blood parasite and if we were one day late in rescuing her, she would have died. Estee was put on antibiotics and was in and out of the vet's office for almost 3 months because her condition kept fluctuating. One day she was fine and the next day she will fall sick. We worked hard to make sure she is tick free, flea free and everything free. And we also make sure she eats her food so that she can build up her immune system. Finally in early August , the vet gave Estee a clean bill of health. Estee has, at last, fully recovered from her illness. As long as she doesn't have any ticks, fleas or parasites and she eats proper nutritious meals, the vet said she will be fine. Estee is now a bundle of energy with a real zest for life. Estee is very easy to handle. She is what we call a follower. Estee is a very affectionate puppy and she loves to give her humans kisses. She thrives when she is showered with love and she is not afraid to show her love to us. Estee prefers to do her small business outside but if it is raining or in the middle of the night, she will do it in the potty we provided for her at the car porch. But, she insists on doing her big business outside. At the moment, Estee stands at about 1 foot tall standing on four legs and less than 2 feet in length from the tip of her nose to the tip of her very, very short tail. Estee should be quite small fully grown because her parents are small dogs. Her mother is slightly bigger than a fully grown male cat while her father is only about 1.5 feet in height. Her fur is one glossy black coat. And yes, her ears are as per her picture - one standing upright and the other flopping down. But when she is in alert mode, both ears will be upright. Estee is now learning to bark at strangers that come up to our gate. She will make a good house pet. She is quite good with children too.",950dd345b,6.0

He's the only one among his siblings who likes sitting by us when it's time to relax. He is still learning to play nice (lots of toys - he does playbite sometimes but knows limits). ♥ Zenith is healthy, has been de-wormed. Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Zenith must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments should be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is compulsory (when he's older). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire - this is for any cat's long term welfare.

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

They were fairly friendly pups who were fostered in only a tiny toilet as their ""home"" (where they ate/slept/poo/pee-ed). They lived for months with almost zero outside world or human contact, and this eventually took a toll on them. ♥ Both siblings were later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). Worse yet, their spirits had been killed and they had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- Good news though!! ♥ Prada and Louis have been under proper foster care and have already made TREMENDOUS progress! ♥ Louis is absolutely friendly (see pics of him below), while Prada is getting extremely curious and edging closer to us day by day. ♥ Prada & Louis are also VERY alert, will bark and make good watch-dogs (not guard-dogs). At other times they have very laid back temperaments. ♥ Both Prada and Louis are looking for understanding and loving new families who can show them the love and life that they lost as puppies, to help them break out of their past endurance entirely. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Prada and Louis should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for temporary needs).

The only pup so far to have learned to bark.He also loves to sleep in the weirdest places-like in between the sliding door and the grille. If it fits, I sleeps! Brownie girl is the one with brown patches.. She is a fatty and loves to steal extra food from the other two.. so she is really a small piglet. But she learns fast and now sits on command, and has learnt that the living room is off limits with a simple NO. The largest of the three, and playful.Not bad for a tiny fella. Betty was named after Ugly Betty because she was the runt of the litter when newborn..Gave her special attention , nursed her from the bottle and kept her in my arms most of the time out of fear she may not make it through. After all that, she is truly a Betty and has bloomed into an adorable brown pup. She is the only one who does not bite me, but bites the others.

He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained.

Or you can send e-mail. These two kittens are Beel and ToraRawr. They are kids of on of the stray cats we feed.We picked them up from the mom...she didn't leave them willingly but they were weaned. So I kidnapped 3 of the kittens kept them inside, gave them bath, fed them etc. The third kitten seemed too scared without the mom and seemed a bit fragile so I left them to them mom, and now a resident of the backyard alley. He seems to be happier outside. We decided to do that because we felt responsible as we feed the adult cats and many kittens we feed just die or disappear before even reaching adulthood being attacked by dogs and other territorial adult cats. Recently one of our precious indoor-outdoor kitten of 10 months went missing; very sad. We love the kittens very much and feel attached to them but unable to take care of them for a long time. They need lots and lots of love, care and time. SO for a better living condition and care we are giving our beloved kittens away for adoption. Kitten's Description :- I'm guessing these 2 kittens share different genes combination. Beel has medium body structure and hair length. More fluffier than Tora. Tora is the bigger species type with normal hair. Beel has a square shaped face and Tora has a longer face... 1. Beel : -Female -Tri colour Fur, fur slightly longer than Tora's. -Yellow/orange eyes -Enjoys playing with toys -Purrs when playing fighting with human hands. ToraRawr(Tora): -Male -Orange fur. -Yellow/orange eyes -Lap cat type. -Eats a lot.Will eat as long as you feed. That's bad. Don't fall for that eyes when he begs for food. -Quite vocal. Meows lot more than Beel. General : These cats will grow up to be quite big when fed well as parents are big and tall cats. Eye colour will lighten as they grow into adulthood. Please try to neuter/spay them to continue to maintain their tame nature. especially Tora as the stray male cats here start to get territorial and fight when grown up. But Tora seems very soft. So he might have been a loser if left outside with the other cats. Conditions to adopt :- 1) Both siblings Beel & Tora are to be adopted as Pair and not separated. One will go berserk without the other if they know the other is missing. They're close. 2) Not giving them away for students who live alone.A family is better. Only adopt if someone will be at home watching over them without being left alone too long. 3) Make them live a good life. :D",923a03e90,30.0

I'm trying to find loving homes for the 4 gorgeous puppies we found and rescued late one night in April. We found the puppies abandoned on a hillside behind where we are staying and I'm sorry to say it looked as if they had been thrown there and left. At first we didn't think they would have the strength to survive after the trauma as their eyes were still all closed and they were no bigger than my hand. How wrong I was! They are clearly born resilient and made a rapid recovery. There have been many sleepless nights of bottle feeding the 4 puppies, trust me we've had our hands full! But now I'm really happy to say that despite their rough start they are starting to blossom into the most lovely little puppies with a fantastic temperament. Sadly, I am only in Malaysia traveling visiting family and diving and I am due to return home to the UK very soon. I have looked into relocating the puppies there but at their age it is very difficult to do so and I fear I will not have enough time or funds to relocate them all. With this in mind I am looking to find them loving families that they can grow and be a part of. They have had weekly check-ups at the vets, of which I have put together individual medical history file for each puppy.

My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.",6469a2a4a,5.0

The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated.

Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer.

Although I'm not entirely sure about that, he acts like a blind cat and his eyes look like it is blind too. At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot. Now he had started crossing the road from one side to the other depending completely on his nose and ears. I wish someone would be kind to adopt this blind but otherwise healthy kitten and care for his medical requirement. At least for his flu. Although the flu is not serious yet. Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here. He has even survived being washed away in the drain and climbed out by himself. He's a strong willed cat and will definitely live if given the chances.

My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there.

I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it! And I’m not a big eater, so I’m pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy can’t keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I can’t.

In october she was found with an injured leg, so we took her to the veterinary. Her leg is healed very well, she now just has to build up leg muscles again, because she did not use this leg for about 2 weeks - best way to train is to play ;) She is well socialized: - loves humans: loves to be petted, likes to give kisses nose to nose, is cuddling and talking - very patient (had to take a lot of medicines and still loves me ;) - not afraid of noises - using litter box perfectly We can not keep her, so we needed to put her back in the compound, when the leg had healed. Update 6th Nov : Bobo has developed some skin problems, it turned out to be a fungus called ""ringworm"". She is treated with medicine against it. Bobo received her first vacination yesterday. She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling. And there is a highly pregnant cat around too... Will check her status every now and then... Update .16 Bobo definitly lost weight - she has grown so nice under our care :( Maybe loss of appetite because of medicine or she does not get enough food...she is the smallest cat around! Still hoping to be adopted... Update 17th November: The skinproblems are gone XD, hair is growing back very fast! She needs to take pills for 6 more days and get powdered 2 more weeks to really get rid of the fungus. Great recovery, tough girl! She is always around the guardhouse, when I visit. As well as her sister, a beauty in white and orange (see photo below and further profile). She is always coming to me too :). They are very different in character, but I think they are a good couple! Can be adopted together ;) Both are so friendly, bonded to humans and love to be petted! But definivly too skinny...

I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

Thanks peeps! Where did Bruno come from?: Bruno's mama came to my house while she was pregnant. She is a cat with a beautiful personality.She had 5 healthy and adorable kittens. However, my neighbors don't welcome cats and she threw all 5 of them somewhere far. However, Bruno's mama is a strong mother and she managed to snatch Bruno back somehow. She is courageous! Bruno himself is very brave, a trait which he must have picked up from her.Bruno's mama has been sent for spaying. Which type of home will suit Bruno?: Bruno would thrive in a home with ample of space. He is not going to be happy in a cage/very confined space.

Pinky is a very very adorable, sweet, friendly, manja and tame cat. She loves dog and is very attached with one of the community dog - Bobby. Bobby is a sweet and friendly dog too and she gets along well with Pinky and the cats. Unfortunately past two weeks Pinky dissapeared for two days and she was found with severe injuries on her back side and it bleeds badly. It was diagnosed as dog bite wound and we believe that Pinky might got bite by other stray dogs around that area..she might think that dogs are all as friendly as Bobby and would play with her. Poor Pinky is still hospitalized in vet clinic. The vet are forced to cut off her long beautiful tail as the tissues and skin of the tail were damaged. We're worried that after she got back to the back alley she might got bite again as she's too friendly with dog. Pinky definitely deserves a very good and loving home.

I was unwanted because I was not good at taking care of my kittens and my very first litter of kittens all perished.

I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter.

He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention.

We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough.

She was rescued from a monsoon drain and later brought to the vets: where she was dewormed, prescribed meds and finally administered Frontline spray. Kiseki had a very bad (and rare) reaction to the (by label very safe) Frontline spray - which sent her into neurological convulsions. She had to be quickly shampooed, put on drips and just when hope seemed bleak - she woke up overnight! ♥ Kiseki returned home after and has been on treatment for mild microspores on her fur as well as delicate foods to help her disturbed disgestive system. She's now in back great shape and one of the most rambunctiously happy kittens you'll ever see! ♥ Kiseki seeks a home where she will be well cared for and her fighting spirit truly appreciated. --------------------------------------------------------------- Character details: ♥ Kiseki is an avid explorer, she's quick to adjust to new situations and loves loves LOVES to play! Her favourites here are our make-shift cardboard tunnels and string toys / balls. She has been great so far at entertaining herself (and us with her antics) despite being a single foster kitten. ♥ Being rescued really young, Kiseki is also extremely human-affectionate. She will grow into a typical lap-cat: loves chest-snuggles and especially having her head / ears rubbed as she nuzzles herself against us to sleep. She playbites but not roughly - she understands the difference between toys and human fingers although she does sometimes get over-excited. ♥ Kiseki has been treated against worms, parasites as well as tested negative against several viruses. She is very clever with the litter-box and is not fussy over food - still too young to be vaccinated. --------------------------------------------------------------- ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: ○ Kiseki must be kept INDOORS at all times (apartments should be cat-proof). ○ She MUST be spayed at the right age (there are far too many homeless kittens like her out there). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for her long term well being (please inquire). Drop me a text (WhatsApp) or call directly (preferred) if you feel that you may be just the right person to give Kiseki a good home.

(5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up.

(6) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them.

You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people.

First come first served. (10) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way.

That's my fav color! its hard to find a blue kitten/cat nowadays unless they are British Short hair or Russian blue. the reason i want to let her go even i really2 want to keep her are: 1. am a student 2. am a wife 3. am a missy to my mom, shes a strokee 4. we got 6 cats already nothing much i know bout this BlueCHEESE ;). 24 hours with her just tell me she: 1. never meows 2. not scared when being bath 3. so manja, likes to purrr, likes to be hugg 4. most of her body covered with muscle, NO fat. so she is quite heavy 5. the coat is so pretty especially under the lights as the coat starts to look like Velvet. it shines and is really2 soft when touch 6. she has 2 big round cooper eyes 7. she got a wrinkle tail just like wrinkle fries ;) 8. she is SOLID BLUE but there is a small white patch under the tummy~ very low white The person that adopt her must SPAY her. its a must! i will ask from time to time as i do not want her to get into a wrong home. Adoption fee will be charged of RM10. whom ever is willing to pay for her then the person is willing to take care of her. (my experience for giving rescue kittens for free turns out not a happy ending for them ~ who will appreciate something for free?!) The person must live in Selangor or Kuala Lumpur only.

He was suffering from skin problem (yeast infection). He was treated at the vet and has recovered from yeast infection. He used to scratch and chew himself until he is injured. He still requires continuous monitoring and treatment for his hind legs as he may have met an accident before we foster him and he is currently undergoing holistic treatment. He is allergic to certain food, hence, he has limited choices in food but he can take certain kibble. He is friendly with humans and dogs, except when he thinks the human is trying to apply antiseptic cream on him when he was injured back then. He growled and snapped as he was in pain. Hence, it is best that he does not go to a home with very young children as they may accidentally harm him and he would snap. He is toilet trained and stays indoor. He hardly barks.

I'm a 4-year old female Pinscher crossbreed, and I'm lucky to be alive. Earlier this year, I was captured by DBKL officers and put in the dog pound. I was scheduled to be euthanized, until me and 60 other dogs were rescued by a local animal welfare association. Our story even made it into the newspapers :-) Nobody knows my past before that, but everyone says I used to have a master because I know how to sit on command! After I got rescued, a couple from Bandar Utama tried taking me into their home. I love them and I love my new home, but I can't get along with their siberian husky. The couple has been trying for months to socialize me, but it's not working and they're forced to keep me separated most of the time from them and the husky. Everyone's best guess is that I got bullied while I was in the dog pound, so I just can't share a space with other dogs. The couple says it's unfair for me to spend so much time in isolation, so they need to find me a new forever home. I love people and kids. I love to chase my ball. I'm not fussy with my food. I'm vaccinated but not neutered. I'll lie on my belly for hours and let you tickle me. I'm happy to stay outside. And I'll guard your house with my life and bark whenever a stranger shows up.

Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",b6fbfa344,12.0

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

He was just a tiny cuddly 2 month old pup then and absolutely irresistible. Even at that young age he showed his potential. He was well-behaved, toilet-trained, intelligent, and affectionate. Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.

At night, I went to the location to meet up with Geetha (the person who posted online in several animal rescue Facebook) to take the dog home first. We managed to get her into a cage by midnight - she was feisty and tried to bite us. She couldn't walk by then. The next morning, my bro and I took this dog to the vet and was told that the dog had broken spine that caused the hind legs to be unresponsive. We were told to put her down to avoid suffering. We didn't want to give up on her when she still tried to bite us whenever we touched her back. She still wanted to live. We took her to another vet and had scanned - she had dislocated spine, not broken, there was some nerves still as her toes did pull back when the vet pinched hard (really hard). She had lots of maggots, some were plucked by the 1st vet place, some by me (eee) and by the 2nd vet place. We used Magtox spray on her, applied med and cleaned the wound around the back of the neck. 2nd vet suspected her neck was chained or pulled with sth tight and the dislocated spine was from longer duration than the accident timing. Now her neck wound has healed with fur covering the area. Her hind legs are not moving mostly but when we pinch her toes, she would pull back her legs. Since June, she has been and is currently fostered at KL Pooch Rescue, Cheras to get swimming (once a week) and physiotherapy. I've been taking her to acupuncture sessions a few time per month to help with the pain and hopefully, she can walk soon. She is not easy to take care of. She will need love, patience and exercise for hind legs. She loves to shred papers and is ok with cats & dogs. Adopter to cover vaccination, dewormed and spaying.

Our preference is for an experienced dog owner without any dogs or pets to adopt Mikey so he can adjust in well. Bull is energetic and athletic thus regular exercise is required.

For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter.

We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal.

We found out that he was there by his extremely vocal expressions. We called out to him and he crawled out onto my hand like a child reaching out to feel a mother's touch for the first time. He was named after the car which was a Toyota; Thus Yota. When we found him, he was so skinny and was crawling from parasites. Fast forward to a month later, he is an active kitten with a doggy best friend/big sister. He is very vocal, very active, and definitely very brave. At times, Pipi has to find ways to avoid him as he would treat her as his scratching post. He is smart and also has a mind of his own. Yota can be a wonderful companion to a housewife or to children but will not do well with a working household. I am letting him go as I am part of that working household and he is locked in a cage almost the entire day to prevent him from running out and being stuck in another car or worse, run over.

She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her ""home"" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her ""potty"", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs). She is a freedom loving girl. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this darling a second chance. Thank you!",7390b70c5,7.0

He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g. On 20 Jan , he weighs g. On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

I'm a tiny version of bacon. I wear socks. I'm scared of people too. But I will follow whatever Bacon does. I wear socks and naturally I'm an angel. I'm tiny. I might be 6 months old. More or less. I was cold one night. I don't know where mommy went. I saw a red monster. But its warm. So I snuggled in. When the monster roar I cried. Then my parents saw me and pulled me out. And thats how I ended up with them. I'm not spayed but I'm vaccined and dewormed. We are compatible together but we could live without each other as well. Let our owner know if you're interested.

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days.

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a Golden Retriever or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 8-June-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 6 points, please read on:- (7) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (8) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (9) No reservations please. First come first served. (10) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way.

She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Theo. - See if potential adopter and Theo are suitable for each other. I will ask a lot of questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Theo vaccinated before being able to take Theo home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I will make a home visit. - Adopter may have to provide me with occasional updates. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

And he has finally brought his tail out from between his legs and is even wagging his tail! When we picked Simba up, he was really so scared and frightened that his tail was stuck between his legs!Poor thing... I don't normally say mean things, but I hope that his owners rot in hell for abandoning him, for letting him suffer physical and mental stress of living on the streets and fending for himself, for being knocked down by a car and injuring his leg and for being caught by the dog catchers! ******************* /14 This is Simba. He was abandoned by his owners when they shifted out of their house. They just threw him out on the streets. The poor boy waited for them to come back for him and refused to move from that road eventhough it was a very busy road. The neighbours in the area started feeding him and they tried to catch him several times. But he would always evade them. Sometime last week, he was hit by a car and his front leg was injured. Again the people that were feeding him tried to catch him but to no avail. And then one idiotic and heartless neighbour decided to report him to the council (saying that he was a dangerous dog although he kept to himself and was just waiting for his family) and poor Simba got caught. The people feeding him called me and asked me to help get him out. Thankfully I managed to claim him back from the council. But Simba was petrified when we went to get him out. He couldn't move. He was frozen with fear. There were lots of other dogs there that had been caught and I know that this is the case with all the council pounds. I wish I could have taken them all, but I couldn't... :( It took us quite a while to finally get him out but we finally succeeded. We brought him back to my place and it took over an hour before he finally realised that he was safe. He had a good sleep, probably the first time he slept peacefully since he was abandoned. He will be going to vet today and I would be grateful if one of you could help foster him while he recovers from his injury, and while I look for a new forever home for him. He will not do well being boarded as he is quite a timid dog... We could look after him ourselves but we already have way too many animals... Please call me if you can help foster this lovely boy. I will take care of all medical expenses and food bills etc. I just need a home environment where he can rest and regain his faith in humans. Or better still, if you can give him a forever home that he deserves, that will be even better. Please SMS or WhatsApp me at if you can either foster or adopt Simba. If you can't, please help share this so that Simba will have a better chance of getting a home. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION: 1. Must not be caged or chained unnecessarily. 2. Must be given clean shelter from the heat and rain. 3. Must be fed proper food and be given access to water at all times. 4. Must be given medical care and attention when necessary. 5. Will only be released to the adopter after neutering. ********************** PS: If you ever lose your dog, please call all the nearby councils and insist that you want to go and check their pounds cause sometimes they will just say that they didn't catch any dogs in a particular area. Your dog could be waiting for you helplessly! And you should check immediately on the day you lost the dog and the subsequent days after that. Cause sometimes they may not be taken to the pound immediately.",115d6458f,8.0

We're seeking a potential adopter for the Cream Scottish Fold, while we continue to try our luck to bring the other cat with us. However, if the potential new family could give both cats a wonderful home, we would like both of them to be adopted together. Both cats are very close. They're mother and daughter. Separation will cause some distress to them so we don't want to do that unless it's absolutely necessary. Note: The cat for adoption is 2 years old and is currently recovering from a skin condition. Ideally, she will be better by the time she gets rehomed.. but if she doesn't. The potential adopter must promise to continue treatment. (We will supply the medication) The photo was taken before she fell sick. Below is a video of how she looks like now. (She needs patience from the new family to help her get better if she's not by the time of adoption.) The other cat is 3 years old. Both cats are quite shy and it takes them awhile to get used to strangers. But once they are comfortable with you, they're very sweet cats. All potential adopters will be screened and must agree to keep these cats indoors at all times. (No cages) They are apartment cats and have never been outside their entire lives. They do not know how to hunt and is incapable of killing anything. They are litter trained and don't scratch furniture if they have their large scratching pole and toys, which will be provided by us as well. Location: KLCC area. If you are interested in adopting our cats, please send us an email with a brief introduction about yourself and your family. Where you live (The area) and let us know if you have any current pets. Do include your contact details in your enquiry. ENQUIRIES WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED. *There is a mandatory adoption fee. The money will be donated to PAWs or Metta Cats to help other cats and dogs in need. Some information about the breed: Scottish Folds are not lap cats. They will only come sit close to you or on you when they feel like it. They do however, like laying on their backs to have their belly rubbed. Short-haired Scottish Folds are relatively low maintenance. These cats usually have a bath once a month, and brushed every now and again. (They don't really need to be brushed, but they like it.. so we do it.) Note: The cream coloured SF has a double-fold.. so there are more cartilage in her ears. This means her ears will need regular cleaning. Preferably on a daily basis. If not, 3 times a week would suffice too. The grey cat is more low maintenance. We clean her ears once a month. She's got a single fold, and her ears have lifted.. so there's isn't much of a fold left. We hope that these cats will go to a good permanent home. We're very sad about giving them up. So do not write to us if you intend to adopt just because they are pure breds, they're cute or because your child wants one. Breeding is out of the question as they have been sterilised. These cats will be extremely shy during the transition phase of going to a new home. The new family must have patience with them. Like adopting a real child.. don't expect a cuddle from them or getting them to come to you for a stroke immediately when you take them home. They need time to adjust to a new environment.. which will take 1 to 4 weeks or even longer.. (It depends on how they come to trust you)",9a1715a97,1.0

Thank you to all who choose adoption instead of buying :) --------------------------------------------- Free adoption but vaccinations and neutering surgery for the puppies are a MUST. We will follow up with adopters for the vaccinations and help to schedule neutering surgery when the pups are old enough. **** IMPORTANT!! **** % of puppies make a lot of noises and cry a lot for the first few days or weeks when being adopted. Because they're being separated from their mother and siblings and also unfamiliar with the new environment. They are % exactly like a small little human babe - cry when they wanna pee and poo, when they feel hungry or because of insecure, and YES - for sure they will cry in midnight time. Adopter need to understand that and please only adopt when you're ready to spend time and energy in raising them up. For sure puppies are cute BUT at the same time they are not easy to take care of too. **** **** **** **** **** We named the mommy dog Moomoo. Yesterday midnight she was found sitting weakly at the roadside, heavy breathing, drooling, no appetite, having high fever, stiff muscle and couldn't stand or walk properly. We sent to vet clinic immediately and found that she suffered from deficiency of blood calcium after giving birth. Immediate treatment was given and her condition been stabilized today but she's still very weak. We went back to her colony and found 6 of her babies hiding under a car. Moomoo're not allowed to feed her babies anymore if not she will lack of calcium again. We took all 6 babies home and taking care of the mom and babies in different places now. We really need to find all the babies a forever home filled with love and care urgently. Please, ADOPT instead of buying. A home means a lot to them. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring dog out - Keep dog indoor all the time - Agree to bring pet for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat them like your own precious family members Please give a home to Moomoo's babies ♥",c2aeb6a1f,20.0

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

She's now believed to be abandoned due to her cataract. Due to her early cataract which is probably genetically inherited, she can only see shadows from her right eye although she has good vision from her left eye. This would caused her to panic and start protecting herself by snapping if there's any sudden movement. However, when she knows you, get used to your voice, she will be as adorable as a kitten. In addition, due to her cataract problem and her not being well socialized, she will start barking whenever there's dogs or cats near her so she may not be suitable to multi-pet homes or has to be monitored when around other pets. As she was likely abandoned by her owner and probably had to fight for food while on the streets, she is still protective over her food while she's eating, so it's best not to disturb her when there's food in front of her. Behavior: - She's toilet trained, will only pee and poo outside the house. - She can walk off leash, she will follow the clapping sound when you want her to follow. - healthy and fit, loves to be with humans. - Her personality and attitude is more suitable for a family that do not have other pets but the adopting family has to be patient when dealing with MinPin and she will eventually listen and be an extreme cute girl when she gets to know you better. The adopter should be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the dog and forgo the need for physical visits to check on her. By the way, MinPin was featured in Star newspaper on 16 February under the Dog Talk column. Thank you, Ellen Whyte! If you're interested to adopt her, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and tell me about yourself especially your dog ownership experience and do expect an interview.",8079e3a1c,9.0

I remember it was a rainy night and I found him crying for his mother by the side of a drain. Luckily I managed to capture him without any issue and send him to his new owner ""Sammie""; a foreigner studying here. At that point of time, Sammie said he will be here for another couple of few years and when he decides to go back, he will find a new home for Tyson. But I did not expect to hear from Sammie so soon about him leaving Malaysia permanently by . I made a mistake by letting a foreigner adopt Tyson but I know that Sammie treats Tyson well. So now that you know Tyson a little more, would you be willing to adopt little Tyson?

She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family.

Recently there was a new dog at home and Ken was kicked out of the house. Poor loyal Ken remained infront of the gate waiting for his ex-owner to want him again but that day never come. Ken stayed there under sun or rain, his soaked body shivering in the cold night.. A kind feeder has been giving food to Ken now and then. On other days he would starve. Found an adopter for Ken but after just one day, the adopter decides once again to give him up becoz her parents didn't like her bringing home a dog. If we cant find an adopter, Ken may be once again forced to live on the streets, in front of his ex-ex owner's gate. :( Now the neighbors started complaining about Ken and attempt to report to the local council.

My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship.

Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",86547ad6d,5.0

If you bond with him, he will follow you everywhere: he'll laze around and watch tv with you, hang out in the study when you're working, and if you let him, he'll even cuddle up with you in bed. We are hoping someone loving will adopt him as we live in an apartment and will be having our first child soon. There won't be enough space as well as attention. We will pass on all of his kitty stuff: litter box, pet carrier etc. This would be a good pet for those first time owners as well.

Trained to pee/poop outside twice a day(but accidents still happen). Currently been to Klinik Haiwan Ee Seremban, St. Angels Vet Puchong & Mayo Vet Taipan. Low energy, need joint supplements & eye drops. Sushi was adopted in a really bad condition from a breeder. Since she was too old to go through another pregnancy, he gave her up. She was not bathed for months leading to very oily fur, nails untrimmed till they grew inwards towards the flesh, teeth unkempt with multiple mobile ones. Dry eyes as well. We took her in last year when she began to recover. She's doing much better now. We have another pekingese as well and he tends to be a little rough with sushi, so we separate them. Living in a flat, sushi can't go outside to pee/poop, when she refuses to pee/poop indoors, she usually tahan till it's too late and her timing gets random, so we used diapers. We are looking for someone who is willing to give her the love & attention she deserves as well as support her with eye drops, joint supplements & diapers if necessary.

She is easy to pick up as she lets you do it, not like some cats. And she loves the adventure of being underneath the blanket! She also loves climbing into any box you may open. Give her a plastic bag and she'll have a whole night of fun. She's also toilet trained. However, Long Ling is not perfect. She is afraid of strangers at first, but warms up gradually and then becomes affectionate after some time. We have rescued other cats before and she doesn't like them. We think that she might learn to like them if we let those other cats stay longer, but so far we haven't tried.

The vet advised it could be self trauma or an accident that might have gotten her left eye, otherwise there is no sign of contagious bacteria or virus. She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all. She is a brave little survivor. She is healthier and more active than ever. I have another adult cat at home, and they just love to play and play.

Has a yard for him to exercise in. Keep him indoors on hot days and at night. It will be good if you have a dog as a companion for him, but he is also ok as a single dog.

She seems to so far only like dry cat food and the occasional chicken meat as a ""treat"". So she is very easy to care for! I would not mind keeping her ....IF I didn't already HAVE 6 rescue cats of my own and also two rescue dogs!! It is simply too much and I will also be moving back to the USA next summer... so I am avoiding adding any more furfriends, that I will then have the huge expense of the move! I hope there is someone who can give this sweet little girl a good home. I would hate to just spay and release her to fend for herself... when she is so friendly, but that is what my choice will have to be, if I can not find a fosterhome or forever home.... instead of giving her to a shelter that might kill her due to overcrowding. :-(",205714da6,5.0

We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks! I'm happy to send more pictures/videos and even set up a time for you to meet him.",a878a916e,5.0

Complicated by her malnourishment she was in dire need of medical attention and was hospitalized and put on drips for 5 days.

Too sad. They were rescued at one month plus by a kind lady who brought them to me in two batches and now being fostered at my house. They will make good guard dogs and their barks even made my two grown dogs retreated a few steps. Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings.

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

It was when I touched her, that it made my heart soar. Despite being beaten and chased away by human, her face tells me she was so longing for that human touch. That few seconds, she was loved, she was special. And that few seconds, meant the world to her. Today we received the sad news that two of Mama Mia's buddies was poisoned to death :( It is very dangerous for this sweet girl to stay on the streets... If anyone is able to give this special girl a home and lifetime of love, please contact: SANDY CHA-",cd9c84ec2,10.0

I strayed too far from home a few weeks ago and got lost. I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days.

I regularly catch the strays living around to neuter and vaccinate them. I did so with that boy last week. He is neutered and got his first vaccine shot. I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him.

Examples are his paws which are muscular and looks like a Rottweiler's paw. Onion is a good dog, he is like every other pet a family would need. Although there is the fact that he isn't really good with toddlers because he is considered medium in size and might accidentally push one over with his snout by sticking his nose in. He is nosy. He protects you from wild life harm like snakes, though remember after he does kill one, please throw it away asap as it could cause a bad stench or he might eat it, it never happened before but it could. Safety first. In conclusion, Onion is a great house pet, he needs space to venture and wonder as he is an agile dog, that requires exercise by running. He is "" okay "" for a family but not recommended for one that has toddlers unless fences are raised. He is also friendly to other people most of the time, but he still protects you from other wild beasts. We hope that Onion gets a good family so that he can protect and live a good life!

Has no regard for his (still growing) size and lays down on human laps right to sleep. ♦ Perfectly fine in the company of people/crowds and other dogs.

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- His story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. B2 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",fa87afa7d,2.0

She was very weak, starving, cold and most probably she barely had strength to move but when we tried to help her she responded with a domesticated attitude. We brought her home from the rain because we know she would die if we didn't help. when we brought her home she responded quite affectionate. However she wasn't very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp. She looks like she is a american eskimo although I doubt she is a pure breed. When we found her she wasn't smelly even. when she was fully soaked. Which lead us to conclude that she hasn't been homeless for more than 5 days. We have asked around the neighbourhood to try to find the owner, however we feel that she was abandoned. Our situation dosnt allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income. As well as we are already caring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago. She already seems well mannered and obeys when prompted to sit. The only negative we noticed is that she guards her food with an attitude. We think this is because she may had had to defend for her self when she was out on the street. Additionally she got along fine with our dog after the initial excitement of being introduced.

They are both preferred to be given to the same adopter. Rescued by me, and I will be willing to get them vet-checked, neutered, and microchipped. Neighbors are feeding poison to the cats, there has been alot of dead cats around.... I suspect they did put some in the place where i feed the cats, but i was lucky to have seen it before the cats.. My only issue is that, Peanuts is very timid and might take time to get used to the future adopter, so they're best to be kept indoors all the time to avoid them being stray again. Both of them must go together to the same adopter. Kitties and I will appreciate your help so much. Thanks for dropping by. :)!",6da1ee245,25.0

We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging. Please be aware that a cat is a long term engagement (a cat can live an average of 15 years). So if you think that Sandy is THE one, I will be happy to introduce her to you.",74d7a26bc,9.0

She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at.

She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around.

We found this little girl abandoned in the street the other day and we brought her home to clean her up and help her find a good family. She is not shy at all! walked right up to us looking for a bite to eat. She was so sweet and friendly that we put up posters in the area to make sure no one had lost a kitten but got no reply. She is about 4-5 weeks old, has beautiful and unique orange and grey markings with a white belly and chest. favorite pass time is cuddling although she loves to play too. She purrs the second you get close to her and loves attention. Whats more impressive is she really entertains herself and is definitely not a high maintenance pet. We travel quite often for business which makes it very difficult to keep a pet in the house. The sooner we find her a good home the better as we will be leaving the country several times in December!

We don't want the dog to end up again on the street. b) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. c) Provide necessary medical attention d) Plenty of exercise and daily walk. You can view the dog before deciding.

Very active and has good appetite (both table or dog food). She has been dewormed, no more flees (we managed to remove ticks from her some time ago with her shampoo). The dog is clean and no wound. She is hugable (no strong smell). We love her very much but our time is not enough as she is being left alone when we are sleeping and at work. (No other person to take care and as her companion). We are willing to have her adopted by a family who has always time to be with her. (most dogs are sad when they don't have companion). Preferably: Family Local who lives on landed house (since most condo does not allow pets)(foreigner might leave her alone when they need to go back to their original country).

I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies.

Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling.

Character: - Meshira is a sweet little creature, loves long hours of stroking and pampering. She is super clingy (will tag alone everywhere and squeeze into sofa space with her humans). She has a very kitten like personality despite her age, she can be very playful and fun. - Meshira has a tendency to get overexcited during petting / play and sometimes play-bites. She knows how to inhibit herself however and understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - Meshira gets along with other sociable / aloof adult cats (those that aren't aggressive) and kittens. She can adjust to dogs as well. Territorial or aggressive adult cats are a big no. - Meshira has been vaccinated, dewormed and spayed. She's not at all fussy about food and is good with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Meshira ""nips"" as a show of affection hence adult owners or homes with older children preferred (seasoned cat people). - She needs a % indoor home. No apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium diet must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals. 2. Kittens to be spayed/neutered when they are 5-6 months.

Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress during the first 3 months or until they are spayed/neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. They will be ready for adoption after they settle down, but I will screen potential adopters now. kittens can be adopted individually or together, I can deliver them to their new home within KL / Klang Valley Area.

We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!",79db05f63,3.0
