# Deadline: May 11th - Data Story




##Set-up & Hook

A bedbug infestation can turn your life upside down.  Nobody knowingly wants to have their home become a breeding ground
for these insects but unfortunately it can.  Awareness can mitigate expensive treatments, impact to your daily routine
and health problems.  Any home can be a target of an infestation and being vigilant and proactive will reduce the possibility
of this happening to you.  A home void of bedbugs can overnight become a breeding ground.

##Rising Insight #1

How does it happen?  It does not take long for a fertilized female to lay its eggs and take hold within your home once they hatch.  There is a gestation period of approximately 10 to 14 days before they hatch and start to wreak havoc. An adult bedbug's lifespan is almost 12 months and, in that time, can lay up to 500 eggs.  How do they get to your home?  Bedbugs can crawl onto your clothing transmitted from a hotel stay, which can have been left behind by a previous occupant, can be picked up from a mattress or furniture (watch out when recycling furniture!), crawl upon you in a public place or transferred in numerous other ways.

Based on data collected by Orkin Canada and transmitted by Global News and The Weather Network to name two, Montreal
ranked 18th in Canada out of 25 based on treatments conducted by Orkin.  In the same poll Toronto, Winnipeg and St. John’s
took the top 3 spots.

##Rising Insight #2

How to ensure that I don’t have an issue?  There are no guarantees in life, but prevention measures taken can reduce the possibility.  As previously mentioned, restrain from taking in used furniture and stay away from used mattresses.  There is a reason they are called bedbugs!  Also, avoiding clutter, cleanliness and sealing cracks will reduce places they can hide and incubate.

The charts above outline the problematic areas on the island of Montreal from a borough and neighborhood perspective.  The Top 5 (worst) boroughs account for 59% of the declared cases since 2011.  The Top 5 (worst) neighborhoods are all part of the Top 5 (worst) boroughs with Cremazie and Parc-Extension the only repeated borough (Villeray-Saint Michel-Parc Extension).

##Aha Moment

We have declared cases in which multiple visits were required.  This can be either attributed to more than 1 visit being required to eradicate the problem or a reoccurrence of the issue.  This brings to light the need for awareness.  We have neighboring boroughs that top the list.  Can this be cause for concern of a spreading issue?


##Solution & Next Steps

Awareness campaigns spearheaded by city hall and managed by the boroughs of the most at-risk neighborhoods should be undertaken
to reduce, if not fully eradicate, this problem.  Looking deeper into the data we can possibly better understand the underlying issues. Integrating other available data, i.e. garbage and special collection schedules, temperature logs, census information, we can possibly identify correlations that would give us better insight into the cause of infestations in the specific areas and based on that predict a possible spread.
